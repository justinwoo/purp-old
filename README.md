# purp

This is my convenience tool for doing PureScript things with Psc-Package. It doesn't try to do everything.

Make new issues or submit PRs if you want anything improved/different.

Normally would named "Bongbong", but that would be hard to type.

## Usage

I only support two commands at this moment:

### Build

```sh

Building...
Installing 80 packages...
Success.
```

### Test

```sh
> purp test [--main Test.Main]
Building...
Installing 80 packages...
Success. Running tests.
You should add some tests.
Success.
```
